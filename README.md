# deno-sudo

`ðŸ¦• #`

Spawns a new `deno` process, using the system's `sudo` command to have that
spawned process gain privileged permissions.

The `sudo` executable will be connected to the console, so it can ask the user
for their password.

When the `sudo` process has achieved elevated privileges, the main original
`deno` process uses the `sudo deno` process to run any commands requiring `root`
privileges. It does this by communicating with that process, asking it to run
system commands or Deno code on its behalf.

The benefit of keeping the privileged process around, and sending it commands to
run as `root`, is that it needs to ask the user only once for their password.
Even if long time passes between commands, which would otherwise time out the
`sudo` elevation and prompt the user to re-enter their password. This is useful
for e.g. scripting installation of operating systems and their components.
